Gold has been one of the most valuable commodities for thousands of years and has been playing a great
role in international trade not to mention that it was also considered as a symbol of power and wealth, to
date whoever has a high reserve of gold is regarded as a world-rule country.
In this research, we are analyzing the gold exports of both South Africa and Tanzania to the world with
the main focus on the United States (US), European Union (EU), United Kingdom (UK), and BRICS
nations under the influence of COVID-19 by overlooking before, after and During COVID -19, which
gives the insight of trade volume data and the impact in the economic exchange.
From 2017 to 2023, the COVID-19 pandemic would have a far-flung negative effect on the world
economy. During this period, the South African economy would modestly expand up to 2019 before
taping off to 2020 and dramatically recovering by 2023.On the contrary, Tanzania experienced consistent
growth during 2019 and only decelerated in 2020 before accelerating afterward in subsequent years. In
terms of influence on the world economy, the UK and the US in particular, as well as Europe still
accounted for a large part of international trade, and investment. At the same time, the roles of emerging
powers (for example Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa or BRICS and Egypt-Ethiopia-Iran-the
United Arab Emirates) were increasing. The influence of those regions and countries jointly defined the
recovery process and characteristics in an already volatile global economic landscape.
